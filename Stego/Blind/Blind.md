If we investigate the source file, we will see some data at the end of the code!

If you think it is a normal base2 code, you are wrong! You will not find any useful data when you convert it.
<br>
So, let's think of the picture and the name of the challenge?
<br>
It says blindâ€¦ it is possible that they mean Blind Language? 
<br>
Yess it is!
<br>
Go to any website that translates from Braille to text. 
<br>
Here is one: https://abcbraille.com/braille

As you can see, every character in Braille represented by of 6 dots

This is how the data looks like in Braille.
<br>
Now let's convert them!

Here you got the passphrase! 
<br>
Now we go back to Kali to enter the passphrase.

Re-enter the password.

And here it is!!
